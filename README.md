## 👩🏽‍🍳 The Process

I started this project as a way to learn everything, literally.

I realised that I learn when I create and work instead of trying to just learn a technology, so I took `Next.js` and the technologies and build an app with what I learn everyday by tackling bugs.

I spent three months of nonstop development for this application, in the end I was able to use this project to get an internship :]

## 📚 What I Learned

During this project, I got my entry into a lot of concepts when it comes with software engineers, frontend and backend concepts. It was my first time using all the technologies mentioned above.

## 💭 How can it be improved?

- Refactoring a lot of code and issues, especially user context management.
- Add pagination for home and explore pages.
- Add stories.
- Update dark mode with a better color scheme.
- Refactoring the UI with newer components.
- Fixing a bunch of issues that are seen in the mobile view related to z-index.

## 🚦 Running the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `yarn` in the project directory to install the required dependencies.
